    <p> So far we have used Python interpreter (command line or Python Shell) to execute our codes. As we progress and
        learn new things it is obvious we need to write and execute multiline codes and for that point, the Python
        Executable files with extensions of ".py" come in handy.</p>

    <p>Till this lesson, you might have used Python Interpreter. You should notice Python Interpreter is not a
        convenient way of coding. That is why we are using the code editor. You may use any code editor you wish. I am
        going to use VS Code which is one of the coolest Open Source code editors in the market, it can be used as a
        cross-platform in any OS and it is easy to use for beginners.</p>

    <p>Before begin please make sure you below prerequisites installed and ready to use for the following topics.</p>

    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Python 3</li>
        <li>VS Code</li>
        <li>VS Code Python Extension published by Microsoft</li>
    </ul>

    I will give you a short walkthrough with VS Code however I must remind you again to check our two free courses to
    set up your environment for Python with a detailed explanation.</p>

    <p>The coolest thing about code editors: They do a lot of stuff for us like auto-completion (code IntelliSense),
        sample-ready to use code (boilerplate), color the keywords, etc! In ttl.academy we colored some of the code
        snippets for your convenience but in real Python console, everything was the same color; When you use the code
        editors you should see different colors. This is called "syntax highlighting", and it's really useful for code
        readability. Each different object such as function, strings, comments has different colors so this will allow
        you to read, track and debug your code, and if something goes wrong you get a clue because of the warning
        message from editors such as unclosed strings or a typo in a keyword name. All in all coding with editors is
        very useful and efficient.

    <p>The best way to keep our code files for Python is to store them in a separate folder per each project. So create
        a folder in your PC for your project and give it a name for example "my_project". If you use Windows you may use
        normal file explorer and create a new folder under a drive for example <em>"C:\my_project"</em> </p>

    <p>or you may use <em>"Windows PowerShell"</em> to create a new folder</p>
    <pre style="margin-bottom: 30px; background:rgb(1, 36, 86); color:#ffffff;"><code>PS C:\> mkdir my_project
PS C:\> cd my_project
</code></pre>

    <p>In Linux, you may create your project file under your home directory. First, go to your home directory using the
        tilde character and then create your directory.</p>

    <pre style="margin-bottom: 30px"><code class="language-bash">your_user@yourPC:/$ cd ~
your_user@yourPC:~$ mkdir my_project
</code></pre>

    <p>and go to your new directory.</p>
    <pre style="margin-bottom: 30px"><code class="language-bash">your_user@yourPC:~$ cd my_project
</code></pre>

    <p> If you haven't installed VS Code go to <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com" rel="noopener noreferrer"
            target="_blank" style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline !important;">VS Code website</a> and
        install it. After installing your editor you need to install <a
            href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python" rel="noopener noreferrer"
            target="_blank" style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline !important;">Python extension</a> for
        linting and code intelliSense. Open your VS Code. You may write "code ." to your command line. This works both
        for LinuxShell and PowerShell.</p>

    <pre style="margin-bottom: 30px"><code class="language-shell">your_user@yourPC:~/my_project$ code .
</code></pre>
    <code>Alternately, you can run VS Code through the operating system UI, then use File &gt; Open Folder to open the project folder.</code>

    <p>By starting VS Code in a folder, that folder becomes your "workspace"</p>

    <h2>Create Your First Python Executable File</h2>

    <p>From the File Explorer toolbar, select the New File button on the hello folder:</p>
    <img src="https://www.ttl.academy/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/VSCode_Create_File.jpg" alt="VSCode_Create_File" />

    <p>Name the file giving it a descriptive name like &lt;descriptive_name.py&gt; and it automatically opens in the
        editor. Let's name the file <em>write_my_full_name.py</em> and save it. We can name the file whatever we want
        just to make sure the file ends in .py. The .py extension tells our Python (if it is installed in our OS) that
        this is a Python executable file and Python can run it.</p>

    <img src="https://www.ttl.academy/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/VSCode_Open_File.jpg" alt="VSCode_Open_File" />

    <p>Now that you have a code file in your Workspace, enter the following source code in write_my_full_name.py:</p>

    <pre class="line-numbers copytoclipboard" style="margin-bottom: 30px"><code class="language-python">first_name = input("Please enter first name: ")
last_name = input("Please enter surname name: ")
my_fullname = f"Your ful name is: {first_name} {last_name}"
print (my_fullname)
my_upper_case_name = my_fullname.upper()
print (my_upper_case_name)
</code></pre>

    <p>You should be familiar with this code since so far we have covered these topics except line 3. On line 3, we are
        using a new way of string formatting for Python. It is similar to normal string but we use the "f" letter before
        the quotation. We can use our variables between open and close curly braces "{}". That is a place holder for any
        Python object inside a string. When you start typing your code, you may notice how VS Code IntelliSense offers
        auto-completion options.</p>

    <img src="https://www.ttl.academy/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/VSCode_IntelliSense.jpg" alt="VSCode_IntelliSense" />

    <h2 style="margin-top:50px;">Run write _full_name.py</h2>

    <p>It's very easy to run our code with Python. Just click the "Run Python File in Terminal" button located on the
        top-right side of the editor.</p>

    <img src="https://www.ttl.academy/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/VSCode_run_python_file01.jpg"
        alt="VSCode_run_python_file01" />

    <p>When you run your code, VS Code automatically save your file and open the terminal panel. The terminal panel will
        execute the write_my_full_name.py. The python command will run for Linux/macOS: "python3 hello.py" and for
        Windows: "python write_my_full_name.py.</p>

        alt="VSCode_run_python_file02" />

    <p>Congragulations you have written your first Python Executable files with VS Code.</p>

    <h2>Next steps</h2>
    <p>You can configure VS Code to use any Python environment; you may use web frameworks such as Flask, Django, you
        may create your virtual environment, and also you may create your test environment. Although all these things
        out of the scope of this course you have already moved forward to the next steps. Moreover, in near future, you
        will find more related advanced topics in ttl.academy. We would like to ask you to stay tuned and follow us.</p>
