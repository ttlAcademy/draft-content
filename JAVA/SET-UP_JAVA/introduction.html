            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>Hi there, welcome to the Java set-up. This set-up serves as prerequisite for all the courses that
                make use of Java Courses. We are going to make sure you can start writing your application after this
                tutorial.
            </p>

            <p>Before jump into the installation, it is better to understand Java Development Environment. </p>
            <h3>JRE</h3>
            <p>JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment. Without JRE we cannot run Java programs. It contains runtime
                libraries
                and Java application launcher that are necessary to run programs written in Java Language.</p>
            <h3>JDK</h3>
            <p>If you have only JRE, you can run Java programs but you can not develop application. For this purposes we
                need
                JDK. JDK stands for Java Development Kit.The JDK is a development environment for building applications,
                applets, and components using the Java programming language. JDK includes JRE plus the development tools
                (such
                as compiler and debugger). Because JRE is inside JDK, you should install JDK to both write and run Java
                programs.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="w-full w-screen mt-8 max-w-4xl mx-2 px-4">
            <h2>Previous Set-up</h2>
            <p>If you think that in the past you’ve set-up Java but are not sure if your set-up is correct, follow the
                instruction according to your operation system.</p>
            <p>We recommend that you have version 8 since it is very common and many of the project still it is in use.
                On
                the
                other hand Java SDK 11 is the latest stable version and has long term support (LTS) version at the
                moment we
                have written this tutorial. Although you can install multiple versions of JDK/JRE concurrently, it can
                be
                easily
                messy. Which version should you use depends on your environments and project requirements. For example
                if
                you
                explicitly use VS Code as an IDE you need to use Java SE 11 to completely setup and run your code. If
                you
                are
                using a test framework, many of them work well together with Java version 8. All in all the aim is here
                to
                show
                you how you can setup correctly your environment. If you have Java 8 or 11 installed, you can skip this
                tutorial.</p>
            <h3>On Windows</h3>
            <p>Open PowerShell and try executing the following statements to check it out.</p>

            <pre style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><code class="language-java">javac -version</code></pre>

            <p>If you get a response with the version number and it looks somewhat like the following output, it means
                you
                have
                Java SDK installed.</p>


            <pre style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><code class="language-java">javac 11.0.6</code></pre>

            <p>Look at version above, 11. This version is known as <code>Java 11</code></p>

            <p>If you get an error message like the following one, your setup is not correct and you should follow this
                course
                and move forward.</p>
            <pre style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><code class="language-jv">PS C:\>javac -version
The term 'javac' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.
Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.
At line:1 char:6
+ javac <<<<  -version
    + CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (javac:String) [], CommandNotFoundException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : CommandNotFoundException</code></pre>
            <h4>Uninstall Old Version From Windows</h4>
            <p>If you have older version than version <code>Java 8</code>, we recommend uninstall this version from your
                PC
                before proceeding with this course unless you explicitly need older version for some reasons. To do
                this,
                open
                the start menu, type “programs” and click on “add or remove programs”</p>
            <p>In the apps & features list, look for java and remove all versions of java other than version 8 or
                version
                11.
            </p>
            <p>To do this, select the java version and click on uninstall. Repeat this process until all older java
                installations are removed, once done, you can proceed to the next lesson.</p>

            <h3>On Ubuntu</h3>
            <p>We are explaining how you can do same steps in linux, based on Ubuntu distribution. These steps are
                applicable
                both Ubuntu version 18.04 and 20.04. Open your terminal and try executing the following statements to
                verify
                whether the JDK is installed or not.</p>

            <pre style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><code class="language-java">javac --version</code></pre>

            <p>If you get a response with the version number and it looks somewhat like the following output, it means
                you
                have
                Java SDK installed.</p>


            <pre style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><code class="language-java">javac 11.0.7</code></pre>

            <p>Look at version above, 11. This version is known as <code>Java 11</code></p>

            <p>If you get an warning message like the following one, you haven't setup java and you should follow this
                course.
            </p>
            <pre style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><code class="language-jv">javac --version

Command 'javac' not found, but can be installed with:

sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk-headless  # version 11.0.9+11-0ubuntu1~20.04, or
sudo apt install default-jdk              # version 2:1.11-72
sudo apt install ecj                      # version 3.16.0-1
sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk-headless   # version 8u272-b10-0ubuntu1~20.04
sudo apt install openjdk-13-jdk-headless  # version 13.0.4+8-1~20.04
sudo apt install openjdk-14-jdk-headless  # version 14.0.2+12-1~20.04</code></pre>

            <p>If you have older version than version <code>Java 8</code>, we recommend you to set version 8 as an
                default
                version. We will be explaining following lessons how to manage your Java versions.</p>
