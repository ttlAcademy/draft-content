            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>Hi there, welcome to the Java Basics Course. Java is one of the most popular programming languages. This
                course was created to help you systematically understand How Java works. During this lesson, we try to
                explain what is Java and what a Java program is.
                We would like to mention a bit more on how you get started with java development, how java works and
                what you need to develop a java program. We assume you have already installed your environment for Java
                development and you have IDE for writing JavaCode. If not please follow the course Setup for Java <a
                    href="#">here</a></p>.
        </div>

        <div class="w-full w-screen mt-8 max-w-4xl mx-2 px-4">
            <h2>What is Java?</h2>
            <p>Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language which allows a developer to define a type of
                data with its set of assets and operation. It enable us to
                <code>write code once and run anywhere (WORA)</code>. It means it is platform-independent. Java code can
                run on all platforms. But how this is possible, we will explain in the following lines.
            </p>

            <h2>IDE --> JDK --> JRE --> JVM</h2>
            <p>Java code is text file with <code>.java</code> extension nothing more nothing else. But the power of java
                is its structure. As we mentioned its platform-independent. Java program needs Java Runtime Environment
                (JRE) to be installed.</p>

            <h3>JRE</h3>
            <p>JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment. Without JRE we cannot run Java programs. It contains runtime
                libraries and Java application launcher that are necessary to run programs written in Java Language. The
                most important part of JRE is Java Virtual Machine (JVM).</p>

            <h3>JVM</h3>
            <p>JVM creates an environment in which Java programs interact with hardware no matter operation system is.
                This is the minimum requirement to run Java. If we want to develop a Java application then we need Java
                Development Kit(JDK).</p>

            <h3>JDK</h3>
            <p>If you have only JRE, you can run Java programs but you can not develop applications. For this purpose
                we need JDK. JDK is a development environment for building applications, applets, and components using
                the Java programming language. JDK includes JRE plus the development tools (such as compiler and
                debugger). The good thing is once you install JDK you don't have to install JRE again.</p>
            </p>

            <img src="https://www.ttl.academy/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/java_dev_env.svg" alt="JDK and layers">

            <p>Once developer creates source code as <code>.java</code> file, an executable java program generated from
                the source code and this is called <code>Java bytecode</code>. Java bytecode file extension is
                <code>.class</code>. JDK is responsible to this generation.
            </p>
            <h3>IDE</h3>
            <p>Of course we need a text editor to write our source code (<code>.java</code> files.) We can even use
                notepad, but popular code editors come with tons of handy tools and extension to make programming easy.
                Since they understand the syntax of our code and offer different type of assistance such as debugging,
                code completion, code intelliSense, they are more than a text editor. Literally they are called
                Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Popular IDEs for Java include IntelliJ, Eclips, Netbeans and
                nowadays Visual Studio Code.
            </p>
            <p>We shortly briefed about Java development environment and component of this environment depicted in the
                below picture.

        <div class="w-full w-screen mt-8 max-w-4xl mx-2 px-4">
            <h2>Our First Java Program, "Hello Java"</h2>
            <p>Now we can observe Java in action. For this purpose let us start writing our first Java program. It will
                be popular Hello, Java! codes. You may use your editor or IDE but simple notepad is enough for the first
                time. Open your editor and write down below codes and save as <code>HelloJava.java</code></p>

            <pre class="line-numbers" style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><code class="language-java">public class HelloJava {
    public static void main ( String [] args ) {
        System .out. println ( "Hello , Java!" );
    }
}</code></pre>
            <p>Executing this codes produces a simple single line printout: <code>Hello, Java!</code>Using this example
                we are going to learn some important features of Java programs and mention a bit more on how compilation
                works in Java.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="w-full w-screen mt-8 max-w-4xl mx-2 px-4">
            <h2>The Source Code and Compilation</h2>
            <p>After saving your first Java files open your terminal and go to directory in which your the
                <code>HelloJava.java</code> is saved. To compile the source code <code>HelloJava.java</code> in a
                command line interface, type below command:
            </p>
            <pre style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><code class="language-bash">javac HelloJava.java</code></pre>
            <p>If you don't get an ERROR, a file named <code>HelloJava.class</code> is created. This is the bytecode of
                the our program and it is called <b>class file</b>. If you compiled before and the same class file
                already exists under the same directory, then the file is overwritten after new successful compilation.
                Open your file explorer, go to your directory and make sure the class file was compiled. Now we can
                execute this bytecode write below command:</p>
            <pre style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><code class="language-bash">java HelloJava</code></pre>
            <p>This command execute our <code>.class</code> file and produces output: <code>Hello, Java!</code></p>
        </div>
        <div class="w-full w-screen mt-8 max-w-4xl mx-2 px-4">
            <p>Let's come back to our source code and please focus on first line <code>public class HelloJava</code>.
                This code states that:
                (a) this is a class,
                (b) the class name is HelloJava,
                (c) this class is accessible from all other Java program components.

                The keyword <code>public</code> specifies that the class is accessible from other program units. These
                types of keyword called as access modifiers.
                There are three modifiers in Java: public, private, and protected. If you don't specify modifiers, the
                default modifier is taken from Java package.
                Every source file in Java has the file extension .java. In a single .java file, we can define more than
                one class. In such a case, at most one class may be public. if a source file contains a class with the
                public access modifier, the name of the class must match the file name. For example,
            </p>
            <pre class="line-numbers" style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><code class="language-java">public class Foo
{
...
}
class Bar
{
...
}</code></pre>
            <p>is acceptable as long as the file name is Foo.java. Yes, if we have public class in our java file, this
                file's name should match with public class name. Let us test this rule with our <code>Hello Java</code>
                program. If the class name is changed from HelloJava to just Hello while the file name remains the same,
                HelloJava.java:</p>
            <pre class="line-numbers" style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><code class="language-java">public class Hello {
    public static void main ( String [] args ) {
        System .out. println ( "Hello , Java!" );
    }
}</code></pre>
            <p>if you compile the source code (javac HelloJava.java), compile the compilation produces the following
                error message:</p>
            <pre class="line-numbers" style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><code class="language-bash">$ javac HelloJava.java
HelloJava.java:1: error: class Hello is public, should be declared in a file named Hello.java
public class Hello {
       ^
1 error</code></pre>

            <p>
                The first statement of the error message state the cause of the error, which is that, to define a class
                by the name of Hello, the file name must be Hello.java. The next statement specify where is the error
                occurred using the “caret” symbol ^. It tells us the error is at the class declaration. The last line of
                the error message is the total number of errors found in the source code.</p>
            <p>Keep file name as it is, HelloWorld.java remove public modifiers from the class like this one:
            </p>

            <pre class="line-numbers" style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><code class="language-java">class Hello {
    public static void main ( String [] args ) {
        System .out. println ( "Hello , Java!" );
    }
}</code></pre>
            <p>if you compile the source code again (javac HelloJava.java), the code compiles, but the .class generated
                is <code>Hello.class</code>, not HelloJava.class.</p>
