    <ol class="list-decimal mx-16 my-4">
        <li>
            <p>Identify a suitable pilot project. State why you think it is the best project to select as a pilot.</p>
            <p class="my-6">Group A is probably the best candidate for a pilot project: </p>
            <ul class="list-disc mx-16 my-4">
                <li>Applications don't need to be changed.</li>
                <li>Defect tracker (Jira) is the same, so only small integration issues need to be resolved.</li>
                <li>Development is different (SVN vs GitHub, Java vs PHP, Eclipse vs Visual Studio). These differences
                    warrant the effort to have a full pilot.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Group B is just formed, without developers, so all development work would rest on your shoulders. This
                may include setting up the defect tracker, etc.</p>
            <p>Group C wants a complete rewrite of your applications, so this would not be a pilot project, but the
                creation of a new TAS.</p>
        </li>

        <li class="my-10">
            <p>In short: pilot will be successful when Group A will be able to test their application with minimal extra
                effort</p>
            <p>More detailed:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc mx-16 my-4">
                <li>TAS is adapted for their processes and tools where needed.</li>
                <li>The tester can easily write test cases in the TAS.</li>
                <li>Tests run automated at least once per day with minimal effort.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li class="my-10">
            <p>Sequence of projects to deploy your TAS.</p>
            <p>Group A > Group B > Group C </p>
        </li>

        <li class="my-10">
            <p>Focus points and success factors for each subsequent deployment.</p>
            <p>Group A: see answer 2</p>
            <p>Group B:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc mx-16 my-4">
                <li>Focus on the rewrite of the webservice, extend TAS to accommodate the added functionality.</li>
                <li>Integration with defect tracker.</li>
                <li>Make sure to keep up with the new developments.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Group C:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc mx-16 my-4">
                <li>Since Group C plans to rewrite the webservice and WebApp, the only focus may be MailingApp and
                    Admin.</li>
                <li>You should make sure you are involved when Group C starts to select a development environment, to
                    make sure the TAS fits with minimal effort.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
