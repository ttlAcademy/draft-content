        <h2>For Loop</h2>
        <p>For loop is one of iteration method in python that is used to repeat blocks of code.</p>
        
        <div>
        
            <p>Below is the basic syntax of <code>for</code> loop:</p>

<pre class="line-number" style="margin-bottom: 30px"><code class="language-python">for var in sequence:
    statement(s)</code></pre>

            <p>Var is the variable that is used temporarily as a container to store the value of the sequence when the loops occur. 
            The sequence is a type of sequential data such as string, list and tuple. The loops occur until it reaches the last element or list of sequence.</p><br>

            <p>Here is the flow diagram of <code>for</code>: </p><br>

            <br>
            <p>To loop over a list or any other collection, you can see the following example:</p>

<pre class="line-numbers copytoclipboard" style="margin-bottom: 30px"><code class="language-python">number = [1,2,3,4,5]
for x in number:
    print(x)</code></pre>
            <p>The number collection contains five numbers. The loop will iterate over the collection and store each number in <code>x</code> variable and then execute the statement to print each number in the console.</p>
        
            <p>When you run the code above, the output will be:</p>

<pre class="language-py"><code class="language-python">1
2
3
4
5</code></pre><br>
        <div>
            <h2>Range() Function</h2>
        
            <p>You can also use for with <code>range</code> function to give you a simple way to list numbers following one after the other as the example below:</p>

<pre class="line-numbers copytoclipboard" style="margin-bottom: 30px"><code class="language-python">for x in range (1,5):
    print ("This is list number", x)</code></pre>
            
            <p>The output will be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">This is list number 1
This is list number 2
This is list number 3
This is list number 4 </code></pre>
            
            <p>You need to note that the range is counted from 1 to 4 and number 5 is not included in the list that is output by python. It means that it includes the first value, but not the last value.</p>
