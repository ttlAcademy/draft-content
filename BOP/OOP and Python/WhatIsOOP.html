    <h2>What Is Object - Oriented Programming?</h2>
    <p>Object-Oriented Programming <code>(OOP)</code> is a programming concept where different structures, components,
        and functions
        of a computer program define, interact and change objects.</p>
    <p>Before starts this section we are going to summarize OOP. It is
        essential to understand that OOP is not a language-specific concept. Many popular programming languages such as
        Java, C++, C#, and of course Python supports OOP. While this is a Python Course this lesson will not be
        Python - specific. All above - mentioned languages differ when they implement OOP but the common concept is not
        different.
    </p>
    <p>In order to understand this concept, it is better to understand what the object is. An object is anything that
        has some attributes and can perform some actions. In the programming world, objects got insight from the real
        world and real objects. Think about it a car. It has many attributes such as color, shape, size, fuel type, etc.
        and also performs some actions like start engine, move forward, move backward, etc. Keep in mind we mentioned
        two groups of things attributes and actions.</p>
    <p>In this example, we are talking about something tangible, a specific instance of cars. When we see a car we can
        define for example we can say "this is a gray, X Make, A model, sedan, diesel, automatic gear car." Because it
        is a real instance of the X make car plan.</p>
    <p>Let's go to the X Car Factory. Probably they have a common plan for all models cars such as A, B, C, D. All
        models
        belong to "X Make" and probably they have a common plan for all A models. And also for all engine types and
        gears.
        In this case, we are not talking about tangible things. Because they are plans, templates, or blueprints for
        cars. X
        Make will produce all cars from these plans. Once they produced they will be tangibles or real instance of this
        plan or we can call they will be objects of plans.
    </p>
    <h2>Main Principles of Object - Oriented Programming</h2>
    <h3>Classes and Objects</h3>
    <div class="flex">
        <div class="w-4/5">
            <p>
                In the programming world, those blueprints and plans are <code>Classes</code>. So we can say whereas the
                classes
                are templates and blueprints for objects, an object is an instance of a class.
            </p>
            <p>Let's this time give an example from a program. Consider a scenario we are building a space shooter game
                using OOP.
                What would be the first things we need to define as objects in this game that have some attributes and
                can
                perform
                some actions? Probably one of your answers would be a space ship. To achieve this goal we need to define
                the
                <code>space ship</code> class. In this class, we would define and store specifications that is common
                for all spacecraft.
                In this way, it would be easy to create a spacecraft from this blueprint. This
                spacecraft should be able to move and shoot. So we would define 2 functions. And for common features, we
                would define variables for width, height, wing-size, color, level, health, shield, power, etc. But we
                would not initialize them. we would not give any value to them. Because this is plan, class. When it
                comes to specific object under the this class, in our case each spacecraft would have different data for
                these features. it is best to assign the values when we create the object rather than class itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                For instance look at the picture an example of game scenes. Each of the spacecraft that begin the game
                on different position than one another. And each of them has different color and different size.
                Initializing the position variable (assign a value to position variable) in the <code>SpaceCraft</code>
                class means each spacecraft object created from this class to begin with the same position which we
                don't want. Similarly If you initialize color in the class, for example "red" then each spacecraft
                object created from this class to begin game with red color. Unless we want this result it is not handy.
            </p>
            <img src="./class_craft.svg">
        </div>
        <div class="w-1/5">
            <img src="./dd.png">
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>However each of the spacecraft would behave similar in terms of place it could move to based on its position and
        therefore it is best to define <code>move()</code> function inside class instead of repeating same thing
        inside each of spacecraft object.</p>
    <p>As a result we can say whereas the SpaceCraft class represents any given spacecraft, a spacecraft object
        represents only one singular spacecraft. From this moment we know what class and object are then let's create
        our first pseudo code class without concerning any language.</p>

    <p>Our First Human Readable Class</p>

    <pre class="line-number" style="margin-bottom: 30px"><code class="language-python">class SpaceCraft
    # common attributes
    its color =  any given color
    its height = any given height
    its width = any given width
    its wing size = any given wing Size
    its position x = any given coordinate position x
    its position y = any given coordinate position y
    its health = any given health
    its shield = any given shield
    its power = any given power
    its side = any given side

    #then class action
    move right()
        do something to move right.

    move left()
        do something to move left.

    move forward()
        do something to move forward.

    move backward()
        do something to move back.</code></pre>
    <p>Great, we created our first pseudo (human readable common language) class. Now we can create as many spacecraft
        as we want from this blueprint.
    </p>
    <img src="./clas_craft_blueprint.svg">

    <p>Again we are creating some instance from our class using pseudo code. Below we are creating our ship. enemy ships
        can be created in same way as well.</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers" style="margin-bottom: 30px"><code class="language-python">my_ship = new SpaceCraft
    (
    orange,
    100 unit (height),
    120 unit (width),
    medium (wing-size),
    40(x),
    10(y)
    65(health),
    35(shield),
    55(power),
    side(our fleet)    
    )</code></pre>

    <p>As we created our spacecraft we can call its functions. In class we call functions as <code>methods</code>. Each
        object created from a class has the same methods.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">my_ship.move right()
#my_ship moved to right 1 unit</code></pre>

    <h3>Abstraction</h3>
    <p>
        This is another and useful principle of OOP. The main idea here to show only the necessary information and keep
        the rest of the thing hidden. Think about the remote control of the TV. We don't know how the remote control
        works exactly, which electrical circuit placed inside. We don't have to worry about that. All we need to know is
        how we can turn on the TV, how to increase or decrease volume, how to change the channel. These buttons are kind
        of interface we can interact with TV. Today modern TV provider they create very cool remote controls but those
        interfaces still there and their changes do not affect our usage, actually we don't much care. We care if we can
        still interact using these interfaces or not. All in all we need to understand the necessary information.
    </p>

    <p>
        Come back to our example, similar to the above example our classes should behave like a remote control. Users
        even other developers of this game should not worry about the inner details of our SpcaCraft class. They all
        need to know how to interact with this class and how to use it. It is crucial, especially since our program is
        getting complex. Consider you have to work in the development team for this game. Your teammate is developing
        obstacles. Wouldn't be nice of your <code>SpaceCraft</code> class able to interact with your teammate class
        without knowing all details about your teammate class. To achieve this you and your teammate need to provide
        interfaces that establish communication between classes. Typically these interfaces are class methods. You don't
        have to know the implementation of the class. You need to know how to use them.
    </p>

    <p>
        The second advantage of the abstraction is each different section or component (a class or a group of classes)
        can de be developed independently. Look at the picture below. Another teammate is taking care of buttons. If he
        makes a change, this change shouldn’t directly affect your SpaceCraft class. If you agree on interfaces as long
        as he is loyal to agreed communication rules and interfaces, you don’t much care about his changes, his new
        codes, debugs. Because of abstraction different sections of the program can progress independently.
    </p>
    <img src="./class_craft_abstract.svg">

    <h3>Encapsulation</h3>

    <p>This principle refers to packaging data with functions that these functions can do transactions (CRUD) on that
        data inside a class. The main idea here protect class data (attributes) and hide them or avoid direct
        interactions outside of the class. But this does not mean other classes can not reach this data. The instance of
        other classes can reach our class attributes through our class methods. These methods generally called as
        <code>getters</code> and <code>setters</code>.
    </p>
    <img src="./class_craft_getset.svg">
    <p>Back to our example, during our game, if we need to see our spacecraft <code>my_ship</code> health, we can call
        <code>my_ship.get_health()</code> method. Nobody should directly access health attributes like this <code><span
        style="text-decoration: line-through;">my_ship.health</span></code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Setting attributes inside methods also gives flexibility and full control to the developer. Consider when we
        level
        up in the game, our health should be increased (updated). So instead of setting attributes individually, control
        these values inside <code>level_up()</code> method is more effective. In this case we can keep track of
        attributes
        depend on one another.
    </p>
    <p>
        Moreover, some of the attributes should be read-only from outside of the class for example wing size or color.
        Such this case you can define only getter methods but no setter method.
    </p>
    <p>Remember our <code>SpaceCraft</code> class. Let's modify this class using pseudo code again and add getter and
        setter for health attributes. <code>...</code> are remains unchanged.</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers" style="margin-bottom: 30px"><code class="language-python">class SpaceCraft
    # common attributes
    ...
    its health equals to any given health
    ...

    #then class action
    ...
    
    get health()
        return its health
    
    set health(new health)
        its health equals new health
    </code></pre>

    <p>In the above code, we have two new methods. We modify the health with <code>set health() method</code> whereas we
        get health with <code>get health()</code> method. When we want to change our logic and modifying our data we
        need to change these methods. For example if health depends on level we can implement in our class. Consider
        each level we are getting additional 20 health up to 3rd level and then additional 50. in this case we can
        add some validation or logic to our setter.
    </p>

    <pre class="line-numbers" style="margin-bottom: 30px"><code class="language-python">class SpaceCraft
    # common attributes
    ...
    
    #then class action
    ...
    
    set health(level)
        if level equals to 1 then health is 50
        if level equals to 2 or 3 then health is current health + 20
        if level is bigger than 3 then health is current health + 50
    </code></pre>
    <h3>Inheritance</h3>
    <p>This main principle enables us to create new classes from other classes. New classes can inherit attributes and
        methods from other classes. Let's look at an example again to our example. Our game is growing. Once user gains
        more bonus and points in the game he can unlock specific power spacecrafts. At first we establish a spacecraft
        class and it consists of many of the attributes and methods common to all spacecrafts. We decide to create
        different classes to represent different type spacecrafts according to their special weapons such as FireCraft,
        WaterCraft, etc. FireCrafts can move slow but fires really big fire balls, WaterCraft can move faster
        but damage of its weapon gives less damage then FireCraft something like that. So these abilities can represent
        with different attributes as well. However they share still much attributes as common as they members of
        SpaceCraft class. We can call <code>SpaceCraft</code> class is a parent class or superclass for these new
        classes. <code>WaterCraft</code> and <code>FireCraft</code> Classes are subclasses of SpaceCraft class. They
        extend their parent class. Many of the attributes and methods will be available inside new subclasses. You can
        extend this sub classes to more subclasses as well. If you need more hierarchy layers. For example, WaterCraft
        class can be extended to IceBall, DropRain, FrozenKing. You get the idea.</p>
