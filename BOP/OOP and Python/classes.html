    <h2>Defining Classes and Instances in Python</h2>
    <p>In this lesson we continue our OOP journey and learn how we can do it with Python. Below we are creating our very
        first class assuming we are creating a car class.</p>

    <h3>The basic syntax of a Class and Constructor:</h3>

    <p>Python class starts with <code>class</code> keyword. Below the first function begins with double underscore
        is <code>__init__</code>. One of the special functions in Python. It always gets called whenever a new object
        initiated from this class. This type of function is also called constructors in Object Oriented Programming
        (OOP). They are used to initialize the variables inside classes.
    </p>

    <pre class="line-numbers" style="margin-bottom: 30px"><code class="language-python">class Car:
    # global attributes (it is valid for all object created from this class)
    type = "transportation"
    
    # attributes
    def __init__(self, make, color):
        self.make = make
        self.color = color</code></pre>

    <p>We can initiate our objects from the Car class.</p>

    <pre class="line-numbers" style="margin-bottom: 30px"><code class="language-python">first_car = Car("Mercedes","Black")
second_car = Car("BMW", "White")</code></pre>

    <p>Now it is possible to access both the class attributes (global attributes) and the instance attributes.</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers" style="margin-bottom: 30px"><code class="language-python"># class attributes
print(f"the first car is the means of {first_car.__class__.type}")
print(f"the second car is the means of {second_car.__class__.type}")</code></pre>

    <p>We are using format string in the above statement. it starts with lower <code>f</code>. Inside string between
        curly brackets <code>{}</code>we can use variables.</p>

    <pre class="line-numbers" style="margin-bottom: 30px"><code class="language-python"># instance attributes
print(f"{first_car.make} is a good car. I like {first_car.color} color.")
print(f"{second_car.make} is also a good car. I like {second_car.color} color.")</code></pre>

    <p>The output:</p>

    <pre style="margin-bottom: 30px"><code class="language-python">the first car is the means of transportation
the second car is the means of transportation
Mercedes is a good car. I like Black color.
BMW is also a good car. I like White color.</code></pre>

    <h3>Class Methods</h3>
    <p>As we mentioned on the previous lesson, methods are functions created inside class. They are actions for
        instances. Objects acts according the methods.</p>

    <pre class="line-numbers" style="margin-bottom: 30px"><code class="language-python">class Car:
    # global attributes (it is valid for all object created from this class)
    type = "transportation"
    
    # attributes
    def __init__(self, make, color):
        self.make = make
        self.color = color
    
    # methods
    def move_forward(self, unit):
        return f"{self.make} has moved {unit} unit."</code></pre>

    <p>Now we can initiate the object and call the new method.</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers" style="margin-bottom: 30px"><code class="language-python">third_car = Car("Volvo", "Gray")

# call object the method
print(third_car.move_forward(5))</code></pre>

    <p>The output:</p>

    <pre style="margin-bottom: 30px"><code class="language-python">Volvo has moved 5 unit.</code></pre>

    <h3>Encapsulation</h3>
    <p>As other OOP Programs, we can restrict access to attributes and methods in Python. Single <code>_</code> refers
        protected members and can be accessed from within the class and its subclasses. Double underscore
        <code>__</code>
        refers private members and can be accessible by only its own class. Not by subclasses or instances.
    </p>
    <p><code>...</code> remains as same.</p>

    <pre class="line-numbers" style="margin-bottom: 30px"><code class="language-python">class Car:
    ...
    
    # attributes
    def __init__(self, make, color):
        ...
        self.__max_speed = 220
    
    # methods
    ...

    def get_max_speed(self):
        return self.__max_speed
    
    def set_max_speed(self, speed):
        self.__max_speed = speed</code></pre>

    <p>In the above codes, we defined new private attribute <code>__max_speed</code>. This variable can be accessible
        only
        inside this class. If we try to access this class from object,</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers" style="margin-bottom: 30px"><code class="language-python">new_car = Car("Audi", "Blue")
print(new_car.__max_speed)</code></pre>

    <p>we get an error.</p>
    <pre style="margin-bottom: 30px"><code class="language-python">Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "d:\REPOS\Python\my_app\classes\basic_class.py", line 2, in <module>
        print(new_car.__max_speed)
AttributeError: 'Car' object has no attribute '__max_speed'</code></pre>

    <p>We can access and modify these types of attributes via getters and setters.</p>

    <pre class="line-numbers" style="margin-bottom: 30px"><code class="language-python">new_car = Car("Audi", "Blue")
max_speed = new_car.get_max_speed()
print("Max Speed is:", max_speed)

new_car.set_max_speed(240)
max_speed = new_car.get_max_speed()
print("Max Speed updated:", max_speed)</code></pre>

    <p>The output:</p>
    <pre style="margin-bottom: 30px"><code class="language-python">Max Speed is: 220
Max Speed updated: 240</code></pre>

    <h3>Inheritance</h3>
    <p>Inheritance enables us to define a class that inherits attributes and methods from another class. The basic
        syntax of inheritance of Python is provided below. We call parent class as <code>BaseClass</code> and child
        class as <code>SubClass</code>. We are sending parent class as a parameter to child class.</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers" style="margin-bottom: 30px"><code class="language-python">class BaseClass:
    # class attributes
    # class methods

class Subclass(BaseClass):
    # class attributes
    # class methods</code></pre>
    <p>Come back to our car class, let's create new child class (subClass) from car class. Under the child class
        <code>__init__()</code> function, we are calling parent's <code>__init__()</code> function. In this way we are
        keeping inheritance of the parent's <code>__init__()</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="line-numbers" style="margin-bottom: 30px"><code class="language-python">class RaceCar(Car):
        
    # constructor
    def __init__(self, make, color):
        # call parent (super) class
        Car.__init__(self, make, color)
        Car.set_max_speed(self,360)

    # methods (It has parent methods, also we can define additional methods)
    def move_faster(self):
        return "I can move faster than ever."</code></pre>

    <p>Now we can initiate objects from this new child class and can use both parent's and its methods and also
        attributes.</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers" style="margin-bottom: 30px"><code class="language-python">regular_car = Car("Toyota", "Silver")   
print(regular_car.make, "Max Speed: ", regular_car.get_max_speed())
print(regular_car.move_forward(2))

new_car = RaceCar("Maclaren", "Red")
print(new_car.make, "Max Speed: ", new_car.get_max_speed())
print(new_car.move_forward(5))
print(new_car.make, "says: ", new_car.move_faster())</code></pre>

    <p>The output:</p>
    <pre style="margin-bottom: 30px"><code class="language-python">Toyota Max Speed:  220
Toyota has moved 2 units.

Maclaren Max Speed:  360
Maclaren has moved 5 units.
Maclaren says:  I can move faster than ever.
</code></pre>
    <h3>Polymorphism</h3>
    <p>This principle explains that the interface, function or condition can exist in different shape or different
        formats. It is one of the main concepts in OOP. With the help of Polymorphism, one method or object can play
        different types of role in different conditions and scenarios. Let's have a look how it works in Python.</p>
    <h4>Operator Overloading</h4>
    <p>Before we learned about addition <code>+</code> operator. This operator has different role for numeric types from
        string data types. It is mathematical addition for numeric types whereas same operator works as concat operator
        for strings.</p>
    <pre style="margin-bottom: 30px"><code class="language-python">number_01 = 5
number_02 = 3
print(number_01 + number_02)</code></pre>
    <p>The above code print <code>8</code> as a result since both types are integer. For string it concatenates two
        variables.</p>

    <pre style="margin-bottom: 30px"><code class="language-python">first_name = 'Wouter'
last_name = 'Superman'
print(first_name + ' ' + last_name)</code></pre>

    <p>This time it result will be <code>Wouter Superman</code>. So we have same operator in different operations. This
        is <code>operator overloading</code> in Python and it is simple type of polymorphism</p>
    <h4>Method Overriding in Classes</h4>
    <p>Like other OOP languages, Python supports methods overriding. In this type of polymorphism, we can write methods
        with same name but they might behave different in child classes from parent classes. Look at below example.</p>
    <p></p>

    <pre class="line-numbers" style="margin-bottom: 30px"><code class="language-python">class Car:
             
        # attributes / constructor
        ...
        
        # methods
        def move_forward(self, unit):
            return f"{self.make} has moved {unit} unit."</code></pre>


    <pre class="line-numbers" style="margin-bottom: 10px"><code class="language-python">class RaceCar(Car):
    
    # constructor
    ...

    # methods
    ...
    def move_forward(self, unit):
    return f"{self.make} has moved {2 * unit} unit."</code></pre>

    <p>Here, when we create instances and call the overridden method, we can see <code>move_forward()</code> method will
        create different results in the base and child classes. Python uses methods defined in the child class and
        overrides to parent class methods.</p>

    <pre class="line-numbers" style="margin-bottom: 30px"><code class="language-python">regular_car = Car("Toyota", "Silver")
print(regular_car.move_forward(5))

new_car = RaceCar("Maclaren", "Red")
print(new_car.move_forward(5))</code></pre>

    <p>The output:</p>
    <pre style="margin-bottom: 30px"><code class="language-python">Toyota has moved 5 units.

Maclaren has moved 10 units.</code></pre>
